1st modal:

Here is your order:
Bagel with cream cheese, coffee, juice, 1 scrambled egg.

Nutrition analysis of your meal:
200 cal, 30gms carbs, 10gms protein, 15 gms fat.




Francis,
This is how I want the modal to look minus the comment to you of course.
If you have a better suggestion(s), let me know.

If the meal meets the requirements - let's say 500 cal, 45 gms carbs, 20gms protein, 10gms fat,
then have a statement in the 1st modal saying-- Enjoy ur healthy mneal.

If it doesn't meet the requirements, then have the 1st modal say 
Current recommendations suggested: based on 2000 cal diet average guidelines suggest: 
55% carbs, 30% total fat, 10% saturated fat, 10-15% protein. 

You may benefit with the following recommendations:( This sentence as well should go in the 1st modal)


In the 2nd modal- this is what I would like:

I will come up with some recommendations for 2nd modal possibly the following:

1) Cut back on total carbs, cal, total fat, increase protein intake + exercise.
2) See an RD
3) Possible healthy recipe video or a reecipe selection that I choose and include. 


Sonal.
